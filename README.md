# JimShepp.com

This Repo contains the files used to build the website located at [http://www.jimshepp.com](http://www.jimshepp.com)

## Background

This website has been created for my Spring 2020 Senior Project (WBIT 4030). The main goal of this was to build something to give employers a way to learn about my career & educational background as well as easily contact me.

Years ago I purchased the domain name JimShepp.com. "JimShepp" was a nickname that has followed me for the majority of my life. At the time I had no idea what to actually use it for, just wanted to own it. Fast forward to 2020, where a lot has changed with my educational and career goals. This project has given me the opportunity to put it to good use, as well as learning the ins and outs of how to design a website and most importantly to me, host a website from my own equipment at home. 

## Usage

The website can be accessed by navigating your web browser to [http://www.jimshepp.com](http://www.jimshepp.com)

## Languages Used

I used HTML, CSS, Javascript, as well as a small amount of PHP to complete this website. I also learned a large amount of Linux commands while setting up CentOS to host this webpage.
